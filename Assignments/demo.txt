In Java, the JVM maintains a string pool to store all of its strings inside the memory. 
The string pool helps in reusing the strings.
While creating strings using string literals, the value of the string is directly provided. 
Hence, the compiler first checks the string pool to see if the string already exists.
If the string already exists, the new string is not created. Instead, the new reference points to the existing string.
If the string doesn't exist, the new string is created.
However, while creating strings using the new keyword, the value of the string is not directly provided. 
Hence the new string is created all the time.
